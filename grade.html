  <section class="intro">
    <p>Given all the work you have poured into your LFS and how
    well you have done so far. I have decided to grade you using a
    practical approach. This means that you will be graded based on getting a
    working system together. Graduate students are, as always, expected to
    preform at a higher level than undergraduates. This lead to two
    rubrics based on your classification. Below you will also find information
    to help you 100% for this project.</p>

    <p>These, these are up-or-down, all-or-nothing grades. Each level must be
    completed successfully before you can move onto the next step.
    However, unlike previous chapters I will not grade it
    piecemeal. You will need to get as far as you can, and then I
    will assign your grade. Further I will only grade it once, so you only
    get one chance! Also, <strong>I will not accept the project
    late</strong>.</p>

    <p>Chapters seven through nine are not nearly as difficult as chapters
    five and six. Chapter eight is the most difficult and finicky of the
    three. I recommend you try your best to finish chapters 7&ndash;9
    <strong>by Friday, March 15th</strong>. That will give you plenty of time
    to work towards a higher grade.</p>

    <p>Remember this project is worth <em>20%</em> of your final grade! It is
    <strong>due on April 19<sup>th</sup></strong>. There is no reason you
    should not get a 100%.</p>

    <h2>General Advice</h2>
    <p>Below you will find some advice that will make your time in our very
    limited environment much easier to deal with.</p>

    <h3>Make Use of The Virtual Terminals</h3>
    <p>Remember your system has several virtual terminals that can be accessed
    via <kbd>Host-F*</kbd> (where <kbd>Host</kbd> is the host key used
    by Virtualbox). I personally had one terminal for the batch build,
    one for the web browser, and one for building dependencies.</p>

    <h3>Using w3m</h3>
    <p>The <code>w3m</code> is the only web browser available on our new
    system. The <code>w3m</code> browser downloads files into the current
    directory. So before running it, change to the
    <span class="file">/sources</span> directory. Also, <code>w3m</code>
    misinterprets patch files as plain text files that should be shown. So,
    you will need to use the <em>Save Link</em> function in order to
    download the patches. Below is a manual on how to use
    <code>w3m</code>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/MANUAL">W3m's Manual</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://box.matto.nl/w3m.html">Useful commands
      you may not have gotten from the manual</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>It can be difficult to read web pages in the <code>w3m</code> web
    browser. I personally only used the browser for downloading and copy-paste
    operations. I had a browser open in my host environment that I used to
    actually read the book and these notes.</p>

    <h3>Mouse Issues</h3>
    <p>To use a mouse in a console only environment requires a special program
    to interpret the signals sent by the mouse device. This special program
    is called <code>gpm</code>. Unfortunately, <code>gpm</code> does not
    correctly recognize our mouse leaving and/or entering the captured area
    of the Virtualbox window. This means that your cursor quickly becomes out
    of whack. To fix this you need to turn <q>Mouse Integration</q> off. To
    do this press <kbd>Host-I</kbd>. You will now have to click in the window
    for the mouse to be captured. To release the mouse from the window, simply
    tap the <kbd>Host</kbd> key.</p>

    <p>If you do not have a three button mouse, as is the case on most touch
    pads, you can make <code>gpm</code> pretend your right mouse button is
    the middle mouse button. Simply change the configuration file below:</p>

    <pre class="edit"><span class="edit">/etc/sysconfig/mouse</span>
# Begin /etc/sysconfig/mouse

MDEVICE="/dev/input/mice"
PROTOCOL="imps2"
GPMOPTS="-B 132"

# End /etc/sysconfig/mouse</pre>
    </section>

    <p>If the mouse stops working issue this command to restart the daemon.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">/etc/init.d/gpm restart</pre>

    <section>
    <h2>Creating The BLFS Environment</h2>
    <p>Before doing anything from the <cite>Beyond Linux From Scratch</cite>
    book you need to setup a little bit better environment. These
    environmental changes are necessary to setup certain environment
    variables and to get working boot scripts.</p>

    <h3>Clean Up The System</h3>
    <p>You do not have a lot of space on your hard-drive. So we need to get
    rid of files we are no longer going to use. This will free almost 1.5GB of
    space.

    <p>Start by deleting the <span class="file">/tools</span> directory. This
    directory contains the packages we installed in chapter five
    which are no longer needed. We also need to clean out the
    <span class="file">/sources</span> directory. Delete the
    <strong>contents</strong> of the <span class="file">/sources</span>
    directory (not the directory itself). We are still going to build
    all the packages below in the <span class="file">/sources</span>
    directory.</p>

    <h3>The Bash Shell Startup Files</h3>
    <p>Before starting on the Xorg build, do the
    <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/postlfs/profile.html">The
    Bash Shell Startup Files</a> section in chapter three of the BLFS book.
    This step is necessary in order to setup some needed Xorg
    build environment variables.</p>

    <p>At one point during this section they will have you create the
    <span class="file">/etc/profile.d/i18n.sh</span> file. You will need to
    specify your language setting. Our system uses <q>en_US.iso88591</q>.</p>

    <p>After completing this section log out then log back in. That way your
    new settings will take effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Xorg Notes</h2>
    <p>Xorg is a software system and network protocol that provides a basis
    for graphical user interfaces. Xorg must be installed from your LFS
    system not the LiveCD. Basically, installing Xorg consists of following
    the steps found in the Beyond LFS book. The basic system is much like
    chapter six, except with a lot of downloading. You must install
    Xorg-7.2, a.k.a <em>The X Window System</em>. <strong>Only do chapter
    24</strong>, a link to this chapter can be found below. </p>

    <p style="text-align:center">
      <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/x/installing.html">
         http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/x/installing.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>Be aware you will need to install LLVM in order to install Mesa. You will
    also need to install the animated png functionality in
    <span class="file">libpng</span> (required later by Firefox).</p>

    <h3>Build Advice</h3>

    <h4>Batch Builds</h4>
    <p>Some of the Xorg builds can be done using a <em>batch</em> system.
    These types of builds require you to create a md5sums file and use
    <code>wget</code> to download the file. The BLFS book assumes you will
    be building stuff as a non-root user. For us this just adds unneeded
    complications. You do not need to install <code>sudo</code>. You will need
    to remove all references to the "as_root()" function, it is unnecessary
    for our build.</p>

    <h4>Required and Recommended Packages</h4>

    <p>Xorg is dependent
    on a lot of individual packages. The book lists out theses packages. They
    come in three types.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Optional.</em> These packages <strong>must be
      ignored</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>Required.</em> Without these packages you cannot succeed. So
      they must be installed.</li>
      <li><em>Recommended.</em> These packages are technically optional.
      However, you will need to alter the build system if you do not
      install them and some of the packages will not work as expected.
      In other words, you <strong>must install these packages</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You will have to drill down through the dependencies. Many packages
    depend on other packages, which depend on yet more packages. These
    packages are installed much the same way you installed the packages
    in chapter six. However, you will have to download and install them
    by hand. This is by far the most time consuming part of the build.
    Frequently, a package depends on another package that you have already
    installed. Be careful that you do not end up installing the same
    package twice as it wastes time. I ended writing each package name down
    on paper to make sure I did not do this.</p>

    <h4>$XORG_PREFIX</h4>
    <p>The introduction section will ask you to create a variable that
    will hold the future installation directory. Be sure to specify
    <span class="file">/usr</span> as the installation
    directory.</p>

    <h4>The Drivers Package</h4>
    <p>You only need to install two of the available drivers: the
    Evdev and the VESA drivers. The kernel options needed for these drivers
    have already been enabled in chapter eight. Make sure you compile the
    <span class="file">mtdev</span> package before making the Evdev driver.</p>

    <h4>Perl Modules</h4>
    <p>One module will be dependent on a Perl module having been installed.
    Lucky for us the Perl language has it own built in package manager called
    <code>cpan</code>. If you look at the bottom of the page in the section on
    Perl modules, the book has a brief description on how to install a module
    using <code>cpan</code>. I highly recommend you use this method to install
    Perl modules because it calculates and installs dependencies for you.</p>

    <h3>Build Time</h3>
    <p>To install Xorg and all of its dependencies will take you a lot long
    time. This is a really complex build. It took me six and a half hours to do
    it. Take your time because it is really easy to forget to install one of
    the dependencies.</p>

    <h3>Testing Xorg</h3>
    <p>At the end of the chapter, the book is going to have you test if you
    installed Xorg correctly by issuing the command <code>startx</code>.
    If it works it will automatically switch you to virtual terminal seven
    and show you a black desktop with some <code>xterms</code> and a clock
    running. This desktop by itself is really terrible. To exit the desktop
    change back to the virtual terminal you issued <code>startx</code>
    from and press <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>. Xorg hates being closed this way,
    so it may print some errors, do not worry about them.</p>

    <figure style="text-align:center">
      <img src="img/startx.png">
      <figcaption>startx</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If your windows are arranged differently, or are overlapping do not worry
    about it. It is not an error.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>OpenBox</h2>
    <p>This build is fairly straight forward. Just follow the directions
    outlined in the book, that is all you need to do. Remember to drill down
    the through the dependencies. The pertinent section in the book is
    below.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">
      <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/x/openbox.html">
        http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/x/openbox.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>You can start programs by right-clicking on the desktop area. You will
    immediately notice that the menu is bonkers. The menu is drawn based on
    an XML file.</p>

    <p>To fix the menu you will need to hand edit the XML file. The menu is in
    <span class="file">/etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml</span> file. If you are going
    to install Firefox be sure to leave its entry in the menu.
    <strong>Undergraduate students, this menu must be correct in order for
    Openbox to count towards your grade.</strong></p>

    <p>You can exit Xorg  using the <q>Log Out</q> menu item. Below is a screen
    shot of what the desktop looks like with the crazy menu.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="img/openbox.png">
      <figcaption>Openbox Desktop</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Firefox Web Browser</h2>

  <p>To build this package simply follow the directions laid out in the BLFS
  book. Unlike the Xorg build you need to <strong>skip the recommended
  dependencies</strong> with one exception. The configure script has a bug
  in it. To work around the bug you must install the optional
  <span class="file">yasm</span> package. You will still need to build the
  recommended packages for Firefox's dependencies.</p>

  <p>Building Firefox requires a lot of space (approximately 3.5GB). I,
  therefore, recommend that you delete the contents of the
  <span class="file">/sources</span> directory before building the Firefox
  package. It also requires a ton of RAM. I, therefore, recommend you do not
  do the build in a GUI environment.</p>

  <p>Be sure to carefully read the directions concerning the
  <span class="file">mozconfig</span> file. This file will require editing.
  Improperly editing this file is the number one reason the build fails.
  Otherwise, just follow the directions in the book.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">

  <section>
  <h2>Making A Complete Distro</h2>

  <p>This exercise is for graduate students only. Undergraduate students
  should skip this section.</p>

  <p>As you have probably noticed, throughout the semester I have asked
  graduate students to perform assignments that often require some level of
  <q>research</q>. I do this because it simulates real life, where you have to
  use your ingenuity to install, properly configure, and use complex pieces of
  software. The goal of this assignment is for you to get a working
  distro with a GUI interface.</p>

  <p>You are free to choose any of the desktop environment's listed in the
  BLFS book (KDE, Gnome, Xfce). You will need to figure out how to install
  them on your own. Warning, Gnome is really hard to install, I would
  recommend you install one of the other two.</p>

  <p>I recommend that you install Openbox and Firefox before starting this
  section. Firefox is required anyway. Desktop environments require the
  installation of many packages. It is easier to navigate the book if you
  looking at it in Firefox rather than w3m.</p>

  <h3 id="fcs">Fully Customized System</h3>
  <p>To qualify for the full 100% grade you have to make a <q>Fully Customized
  System.</q> What does this mean? Your system will have to have the following
  properties for a newly created user:
  <ol>
    <li>It boots directly the display manager, not the console.</li>
    <li>A newly created user can log in.</li>
    <li>The new user's desktop uses a non-default background.</li>
    <li>The new user's desktop is completely configured with working icons.</li>
    <li>The environment must have a text editor and a terminal emulator besides
    <code>xterm</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Known Issues</h3>
  <p>These are known problems encounter by students as they were competing this
  section of the build. They are meant to help you avoid pitfalls other
  students fell into.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gnome3 will only be able to run in "fall back mode." The reason behind
    this is that Gnome3 requires a hefty graphics card. We are forcing the
    VM to use VESA graphics, which is the worst of the available
    options. To get the kernel to recognize the fake VM graphics is very
    difficult and well beyond the scope of the class. Just be aware you will not
    be getting the <em>true</em> Gnome3 experience from you build.</li>

    <li>If you install the NetworkManager package, you will need to disable
    and remove all links to the <code>/etc/init.d/network</code> start up
    script we installed in chapter 7.</li>

    <li>The current GDM package does not seem to work with Virtualbox.
    This this display manager is used by both Xfce and Gnome. Hence if you
    are building either of these environments, you will need to install the
    <a href="http://slim.berlios.de/">SLiM</a> display manager rather than
    GDM. Read the <code>INSTALL</code> file that comes with SLiM in order
    to figure out how to install it. You will need to make a custom SLiM init
    script. You will, also, need to create by hand the symbolic links in the
    proper run-level directories. Do not try to use the initab method to start
    SLiM, it will not work properly.</li>
  </ul>

  <section>
  <h2>LXDE</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>This part of the assignment is much easier to complete after you have
    done the Openbox and Firefox portions. I recommend doing this build from
    within the Openbox environment. It is much easier to read and understand
    the web pages in Firefox.</li>

    <li>Install the <span class="file">hicolor-icon-theme</span>,
    <span class="file">desktop-file-utils</span>,
    <span class="file">xdg-utils</span>,
    <span class="file">d-bus</span>, and the
    <span class="file">d-bus Glib Bindings</span> from the BLFS book before
    starting the LXDE install.</li>

    <li>LXDE depends on <span class="file">d-bus</span>. After installing
    <span class="file">d-bus</span> and the bindings you will need to install
    its boot scripts. These can be found in the <q>BLFS Boot Scripts</q>
    section of the book. After you finish the <span class="file">d-bus</span>
    section you need to reboot the VM so it will work properly.</li>

    <li><a href="http://cblfs.cross-lfs.org/index.php/LXDE">This is an outdated
    guide on how to build LXDE.</a> It should give you a pretty good idea on
    the order you will need to build the packages in. <strong>You must use
    the most updated ones from the LXDE website</strong> not these out dated
    packages. Be warned the dependencies have changed considerably since this
    was written.</li>

    <li>Many of the builds will have you use a prefix switch when you run
    the configure script. Use <span class="file">/usr</span> just like you
    did for Xorg. However, the configure script will then want to erroneously
    store configuration files in <span class="file">/usr/etc</span> directory.
    This is wrong. To fix it also use the <q>--sysconfdir=/etc</q> switch
    when running the configure scripts, unless told otherwise.</li>

    <li>One of the packages depends on <span class="file">libwnck</span> and
    another on the <span class="file">VTE</span> package. The BLFS
    book has two versions of these packages, use the one that depends on
    GTK+2.</li>

    <li>Use the non-obconf version of LXAppearance. There is a bug that causes
    the configure script will not include the Xorg libraries (verison 0.3.0).
    The sed scirpt fixes this bug.
    <pre class="cmd">
sed -i 's/gtk+/x11 gtk+/' configure.in &&
autoreconf -v && ./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make && make install</pre></li>

    <li>Skip the GtkNetCat, LXLauncher, LXNM, and LXMusic packages.</li>

    <li>When building <code>lxdm</code> you need to apply
    <a href="http://lxde.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=lxde/lxdm;a=commitdiff_plain;h=d4e41ecb;hp=f0951bdf736026b041001e846d2cb93f7f2852e1">
    this patch</a>. Otherwise LXDE will use up 100% of your CPU (version
    0.4.1)</li>

    <li>The default <span class="file">lxdm.conf</span> file has the wrong file
    path for the <em>greeter</em> option. Be sure to fix it, otherwise you
    will get a blank screen when you launch <code>lxdm</code>.

    <li>You will have to create the start up file
    <span class="file">/etc/init.d/lxdm</span> and the symbolic links in the
    correct run levels. Use <span class="file">/etc/init.d/template</span> as
    a base for the <code>lxdm</code> init script. To get LXDM to run as a
    daemon, pass it the <code>-d</code> option on startup. When creating the
    symbolic links, be sure to remember that LXDE depends on
    <code>d-bus</code>. Also be sure to use <strong>relative paths</strong>
    when creating the symbolic links.</li>

    <li>Because Firefox was built before we had a working desktop system, you
    may need to create/install the <span class="file">.desktop</span> file
    manually so it shows up in the menu.</li>
  </ul>
