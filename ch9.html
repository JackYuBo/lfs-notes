    <p>There is nothing for you to do in this chapter.  This is the
    make or break time. Either your machine will boot or it won't.
    <strong>Take a snapshot before rebooting!</strong></p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Rebooting</h2>
    <p>To reboot your machine simply click Logout in the LXDE program
    menu. Then you just need to click Reboot in the resulting window.</p>

    <p>After your machine has shutdown, it will reload using a BIOS just like
    a physical machine. You need to set the boot device to your hard drive.
    You can do this by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd> at the BIOS screen (select
    the first hard drive). LFS distro should be the only thing listed there. Next,
    comes the scary part. The kernel will attempt to load. If your kernel
    fails you will get a "Kernel Panic!" message. This means you did not
    compile or install your kernel correctly. Kernel loading is followed by
    the boot scripts running through the init process. Everything should
    display a green <code style="color:#0F0">OK</code>. If not then you have
    problems. Finally, you should see a login prompt.</p>

    <h2>Problems?</h2>
    <p>If you have any problems you will need to come and see me. I can't
    really give general advice here because each person will probably have
    something different wrong with their system. So come and see me with your
    problems.
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Success???</h2>
    <p>Lets suppose your machine worked right off the bat. If your machine
    booted perfectly, then you will be confronted with a login prompt. Go
    ahead and login into the root account.</p>

    <h3>Basic Tools Check</h3>
    <p>Your basic tools probably installed correctly if you got this far. To
    check, examine the contents of the
    <span class="file">/bin</span> and <span class="file">/usr/bin</span>
    directories by running the command below. The command below display any
    programs with a zero file size, it should <strong>only print the
    word</strong> <q>done</q>.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">find {,/usr}/bin -size 0 && echo done</pre>

    <h3>Mouse Deamon Check</h3>
    <p>Next we need to see if your mouse daemon is working. Try clicking on
    the VM's window and move your mouse around try highlighting and pasting
    text using the middle-click.</p>

    <h3>Network Check</h3>
    <p>Next we need to see if DHCP worked. To check this we will use two steps
    first we will see if we have an IP address. Virtual box usually assigns
    IPs in the 10.0.*.* range. I have given you an example output for the
    command below. Don't be startled if your output is slightly different than
    mine. What matters is the <em>inet</em> field has a valid IP range.</p>
    <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">ip addr show eth0 | grep inet</span>
    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global eth0
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:feb29:869/64 scope link</pre>

    <p>Next we need to check if we can talk to the outside world. To do
    that we will use <code>w3m</code> to lookup a website.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">w3m www.google.com</pre>
    
    <p>Finally, lets make sure that wget is working by accessing Google via
    HTTPS. This command should print <q>Success</q></p>
    
    <pre class="cmd">wget https://www.google.com --no-check-certificate -O/dev/null && echo Success</pre>
    
    <h3>Fstab Check</h3>
    <p>We need to check that you mounted all of your filesystems correctly.
    Issue the command below. The order of the lines may be different, just make
    sure that the marked entries are there.</p>
    
    <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">mount</span>
<mark>/dev/sda1 on /</mark> type ext4 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
tmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw)
devtmpfs on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,nosuid,mode=0755)
<mark>/dev/sda2 on /home</mark> type ext4 (rw)
<mark>/dev/sdb1 on /sources</mark> type ext4 (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)</pre>

    <h3>Eject CDROM</h3>
    <p>Our fake CD is still in the virtual drive. We need to eject it so
    your machine will reboot normally. To do this click <em>Devices &rarr;
    CD/DVD Devices &rarr; Remove disk from virtual drive</em> in the
    VM's menu bar. It may ask want you to <q>force unmount</q> the disk. This
    is normal. Go ahead and unmount it.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:3em">If everything works you did
    it!!!!<br>
    Hurray for you!</h1>
