    <article>
    <section class="intro">
    <p>You should read and follow all the directions found in
    chapter five. Below are some helpful hints to make building chapter five
    easier. Always read these notes first.
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Rebooting the VM</h2>
      <p>Whenever you reboot a LiveCD it forgets about any changes you made
      to the running system, such is the nature of LiveCD's. Chapters two and
      four have you perform several changes to the host operating system.
      Since these changes do not persist between reboots, you will have to
      repeat them each time the system boots. Below is "script" you can copy
      and paste to return you to a working state. It essentially repeats the
      necessary steps laid out in chapters two and four.</p>

      <p>You only need to run this script if you rebooted or shut down your
      VM. If you used "Save the machine state," you do not need to run this
      script.</p>

      <pre class="cmd">export LFS=/mnt/lfs
mkdir -v /mnt/lfs
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda1 $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda2 $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 $LFS/sources
if ! grep -q sda3 /proc/swaps; then /sbin/swapon -v /dev/sda3; fi
groupadd lfs
useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -b $LFS/home -k /dev/null lfs
ln -sv $LFS/tools /tools
su - lfs
</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Uncompressing The Packages</h2>
    <p>Before starting chapter five you need to uncompress all of the packages
    you downloaded in the chapter three notes. Before starting be sure your
    terminal is using the <em>lfs</em> user. If you do this as root you will
    quickly run into significant problems.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources
for i in *.gz *.bz2 *.xz ; do echo "Unarchiving: $i"; tar xf $i ; done</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Building Advice</h2>
    <p>An unwritten direction is that each build should be executed
    inside that item's source directory. <strong>Start every section inside
    that package's directory!</strong> For example, the directions for
    section <q>5.17 Bzip2</q> should be done inside of the
    <span class="file">$LFS/sources/bzip2-1.0.6</span> directory. Some
    directions will have you create a special build directory. None the less,
    you should still <strong>start</strong> the section inside the package's
    source directory. The book will then have you use paths relative to that
    source directory. Towards the end of the chapter when the build times get
    short, it is easy to mess this up and build the same package over again,
    but think you built the next one. Be careful!</p>

    <p>In this chapter be sure to <strong>skip the tests & checks</strong>.
    They are not necessary to for this chapter and can be quite time
    consuming.</p>

    <h3>Combining Directions</h3>

    <p>Many of the programs, starting in section 5.13, contain a variation on
    the <code>./configure &rarr; make &rarr; make install</code> system. Doing
    each stage separately
    can be a problematic. It is easy to think you issued <code>make
    install</code> when in fact you are on the <code>make</code> stage.
    To help solve this you can combine directions into a single command
    by separating the parts of the command with the <code>&&</code>
    operator. This operator acts as a <em>short-circuiting logical and</em>.
    Therefore, each command in the chain is only executed if all the preceding
    commands executed successfully. For example, you could build Sed (and many
    other packages) like this:</p>

    <pre class="cmd">./configure --prefix=/tools && make && make install</pre>

    <h3>Before doing GCC and BinUtils Second Pass</h3>
    <p>You need to delete the build directories that you used previously. You
    also need to delete the directory that was created when we uncompressed
    the tar-ball. You then need to uncompress the two files again. Failure to
    do this will result in Chapter Six failing mysteriously, and you will have
    to repeat a lot of work. Not doing this creates a subtle error that cannot
    be detected until you are well into  Chapter Six. To fix this problem you
    will have to <em>repeat all</em> of chapter five.
    <strong>Consider yourself warned!!!</strong></p>

    <h4>Section 5.7</h4>
    <p>Before starting this section, you need to get rid of the
    <span class="file">gcc</span> directories to free up enough space for
    the <span class="file">glibc</span> package to compile.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">rm -rf $LFS/sources/gcc*/</pre>

    <h4>Section 5.9</h4>
    <p>Before starting the this section run these two commands. This will
    give you a brand-new source directory.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources
rm -rf binutils*/
tar xjf binutils*.tar.bz2</pre>

    <h4>Section 5.10</h4>
    <p>Before starting the this section run these two commands. This will
    give you a brand-new source directory.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources
rm -rf {gcc,binutils,glibc}*/
tar xjf gcc*.tar.bz2</pre>

    <p><strong>After completing this section</strong> run this command. It will
    scavenge 2GB disk space. Remember the virtual hard disk only has 4GB of
    space, so the savings are enormous.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources && rm -rf {gcc,binutils,glibc}*/</pre>
    </section>

    <h2>Timing</h2>
    <p>Keeping track of how long things are taking is highly advised. It is very
    important that you time the first build very precisely. All the other timings
    are given as a relative measurement to this build's time. This measurement is
    called a SBU. Below is a group of commands that you need to copy and paste
    that will notify you of the total time taken for section 5.4 of the book.
    <strong>This script should be done instead of following the directions
    inside of section 5.4.</strong></p>

    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources/binutils*/
time {
mkdir -v ../binutils-build &amp;&amp;
sed -i -e 's/@colophon/@@colophon/' \
       -e 's/doc@cygnus.com/doc@@cygnus.com/' bfd/doc/bfd.texinfo &amp;&amp;
cd ../binutils-build &amp;&amp;
../binutils*/configure \
    --prefix=/tools \
    --with-sysroot=$LFS \
    --with-lib-path=/tools/lib \
    --target=$LFS_TGT  \
    --disable-nls --disable-werror &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install
}</pre>

    <p>The <code>time</code> command outputs three times, but you only really
    care about the first. This is the actual amount of time taken to perform
    all the commands within the braces. The commands above gave me the
    following output. We only care about the <em>real</em> timing, the others
    do not matter.</p>

    <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">time { ... }</span>
<mark>real    2m2.590s</mark>
user    1m14.593s
sys     0m10.973s</pre>

    <p>The <em>real</em> timing is your SBU! Given this SBU we can calculate
    how much time you will need to finish chapter five. I went through the
    chapter and totaled the listed SBU's and came up with 27.40 SBU's. So on
    my computer it will take approximately <strong>55 minutes</strong>, i.e.
    (2 * 27.40).

    <h2>Taking Snapshots</h2>

    <p>One of the major benefits of using a virtual machine to compile LFS is
    that you can take snapshots. Snapshots allow you to take a <q>picture</q>
    of the virtual machine. This picture includes the current state of the
    hard drive and if the machine is running it also records what is in RAM.
    You can then later revert the virtual machine to this state.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend that you take frequent snapshots of your virtual
    machine. The directions in the book are extremely detailed and easy to
    mess up. Everyone makes mistakes during this process (I have had to
    start over five times so far). Snapshots allow you
    to revert the machine to a <q>good</q> state before the mistake
    happened.</p>

    <p>If you do not take snapshots you may have to start all over at some
    point. Snapshot will help you minimize any wasted effort.</p>

    <p>I recommend that you take a snapshot before starting each chapter.
    Also, take one after the first and second pass of GCC because it takes the
    longest to compile.</p>
