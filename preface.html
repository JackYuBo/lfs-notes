<article>
  <section class="intro">
  <p>These "notes" are designed to be used in addition to the instructions
  found in the LFS book. They are specially formulated to help you avoid many
  of the pitfalls first time LFS installers run into. They are predicated on the
  idea that you will be installing the system using a VM. For simplicity's sake,
  I am mandating that you <strong>must use
  <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a></strong> as the
  virtualization software.</p>

  <p>All of the "notes" together comprise an additional 30+ printed pages of
  help. Following the directions found in the notes and in the LFS book
  precisely is critical to successfully installing LFS.</p>

    <h2>Typographic Conventions In These Notes</h2>
    <p>There are several different conventions for how things are written in
    these notes. Pay special attention to what the different typographic
    formats are.</p>

    <p>Commands to be entered into a terminal appear as follows. Each command is
    written onto a single line. They are grouped together inside of gray boxes
    like the one below. The example below would have you type into a terminal:
    <code>cd $LFS</code> followed by <code>ls</code> followed by
    <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS
ls
pwd</pre>

    <p>Occasionally, you will need to edit some files. The result of the edit
    will appear as below. Notice that the <em>file's path is displayed
    at the top</em> in the red header.

    <pre class="edit"><span>~/.bashrc</span>
set +h
umask 022
LFS=/mnt/lfs
LC_ALL=POSIX
PATH=/tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
export LFS LC_ALL PATH</pre>

    <p>Rarely, I will need to inform you about the exact output of a
    command. This is usually done so you can manually check that a step was
    completed successfully. The command is the first line (in the gray box) and
    the commands output appears below it (in white). If your attention needs
    to be drawn to a specific area of the output it will be highlighted.</p>
    <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">df -h</span>
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/lfs-cd    1.5G  1.3G  197M  87% /
/dev/sda1             5.7G  140M  5.3G   3% /mnt/lfs
<mark>/dev/sda2             497M   19M  453M   4% /mnt/lfs/home</mark></pre>


    <p>Another convention is how files, commands, and key board shortcuts are
      written. Below is a list of these conventions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Files and directories, like <span class="file">/etc</span>, are written in
      monospaced font.</li>
      <li>Commands, like <code>ls</code>, are written in a bold monospaced
        font.</li>
      <li>Keyboard shorcuts, like <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, are written using a comic
        style font.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minimum System Requirements</h2>
    <p>Just like any other software an LFS install has minimum requirements it
    expects from the operating system. The requirements below are for the
    <em>physical host machine</em>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The host machine must have at least 2GB of RA.M</li>
      <li>You will need 8GB of free, portable, storage space.</li>
      <li>This
        <a href="./lfs-cd.iso">
        LFS LiveCD ISO</a> file. This is a custom Linux distribution created
        by me. It is based on Debian and is setup so that it has
        all the required software to build LFS.</li>
      <li>VirtualBox virtualization software.</li>
    </ol>
