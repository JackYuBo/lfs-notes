  <h1>Chapter 3 Packages and Patches</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
  <section class="intro">
  <p class="intro">Chapter three of the book details fetching and uncompressing
  all the packages and patches we need for our system. That is 78
  downloads, and some of the packages are difficult to find. Also, the system
  basically requires that all of the different versions be exactly as
  specified, which makes it even more difficult. Lucky for us, our the LFS
  authors created a nice list of the packages that <code>wget</code> can
  use to download them all at once.The little script below encapsulates
  essentially all of chapter three's directions.</p>

  <h2>Obtaining the Packages and Patches</h2>

  <p>First, we are going to use the second hard drive's mount point as the
  directory that will hold all of the packages and patches. This directory gets
  the special <em>sticky</em> permission. What this does is it allows anyone
  to write to the directory, but only a file's owner can delete it. We will then
  use <code>wget</code> to download all of the file's from a list that is
  included with our book. We will also check that all the files are correct
  by comparing their MD5 checksums to a list of pre-calculated
  checksums.</p>

  <pre class="cmd">
chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources
pushd $LFS/sources
wget -i ~/Desktop/LFS/wget-list -P $LFS/sources
md5sum -c ~/Desktop/LFS/md5sums
popd</pre>

  <p>As of Febuary 5, 2014 the URL for shadow included included in the
  <span class="file">wget-list</span> file is incorrect. It has to be downloaded
  separately. Also because of this error, the md5sum check will issue a single
  warning, this can be ignored.</p>

  <pre class="cmd">
wget http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/shadow/shadow_4.1.5.1.orig.tar.gz</pre>
