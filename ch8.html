  <article>
  <section class="intro">
    <p>As with chapter seven, this chapter's notes are broken up
    by section. So read each section's notes before doing what is listed in
    that section of the book.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8.2 Creating the /etc/fstab File</h2>
    <p>You should read this section carefully. The information contained
    within this section is extremely useful. To fill in the appropriate
    entries inside the <span class="file">/etc/fstab</span> file, recall how
    we partitioned the system in chapter two (check the chapter two notes if
    you forgot). Notice our layout is completely different than what is talked
    about in the book. Be sure to still mount
    <span class="file">/dev/sdb1</span> at
    <span class="file">/sources</span> we will need it later. I am leaving it
    as an exercise for you to figure out a working
    <span class="file">/etc/fstab</span> file.</p>

    <h2>8.3 Building The Kernel</h2>
    <p>Building a Linux kernel is extremely easy. However, getting a kernel
    that works correctly can be pretty tough. Normally you would need to make
    sure that all your hardware's drivers would be loaded properly. Luckily,
    because we are using a VM, I can know what drivers are needed. We are
    going to build a monolithic kernel, i.e. a kernel with everything built
    in. The reason being that it will cut the number of possible errors that
    can occur by two-thirds.</p>

    <p>Carefully follow the directions up to the second <code>make</code>.
    Here you will need to make various menu selections to create a working
    kernel. Carefully go through the listing below an make sure that each
    option listed is selected. Some of the options will be selected by
    default, others you will have to turn on yourself. Make sure each option
    is listed with an <span class="file">*</span>, except for the first option
    which needs to be turned off.</p>

    <pre class="edit">
<span class="cmd">source /etc/profile
make defconfig
make LANG=$LANG LC_ALL= menuconfig</span>

    <p>When you are finished making your selections, continue following the
    book's directions.</p>

    <h2>8.4 Making the LFS System Bootable</h2>
    <p>Read this section carefully. You cannot just blindly follow the
    examples and hope that your system will boot.</p>

    <p>Ignore <cite>section 8.4.1</cite>. This rescue disk is
    unnecessary in our case because we can use the LiveCD.</p>

    <p>Use the following file for your menu list. I would recommend using
    <code>vim</code>, instead of the <code>cat</code> entry as listed in the
    book.</p>

    <pre class="edit"><span>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</span>
set default=0
set timeout=3

insmod ext2
set root=(hd0,1)

menuentry "GNU/Linux, LFS" {
    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.2-lfs-7.4 root=/dev/sda1 ro vga=773
}
</pre>

  <p>Linux virtual terminals by default will boot to a 80 character by 24 line
  resolution (roughly 640x480 pixels). This is really, really small. To fix
  this we compiled the kernel with frame buffer support. You turn this on with
  the kernel cheat code <code>vga</code>. The value of the vga parameter
  defines the color depth and resolution size. The value 773 corresponds to
  1024x768 with 256 colors. That may be too large for some laptop monitors. You
  can reduce it to 800x600 using code 771 instead. If the window is still too
  big, go ahead and remove the <code>vga</code> cheat code all together.</p>
