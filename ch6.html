  <h1>Chapter 6 Installing Basic System Software</h1>
</header>
<article>
  <section class="intro">
    <p>You should read and follow all the directions found in
    chapter six. Below are some helpful hints to make building chapter six
    easier.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Root User</h2>
    <p>Before starting chapter six, be sure you are the <strong><em>root</em>
    user</strong>, not the <em>lfs</em> user. You were supposed to switch back
    to the <em>root</em> user in section 5.34. It is an easy direction to miss.
    If you did not switch, then be sure to repeat section 5.34.</p>

    <p>You can switch back out of the <em>lfs</em> user by using the
    <code>exit</code> command. After switching you need to double check that
    the <code>$LFS</code> variable still has the correct value. Check the
    variable's value with the command below. If the variable is empty or the
    value is incorrect, then
    refer to section 4.1.</p>

    <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">echo $LFS</span>
<mark>/mnt/lfs</mark></pre>

    <h2>Uncompressing The Packages</h2>
    <p>The first thing we need to do is to start with clean slate for chapter
    six. We don't want any object files from the previous chapter to sneak
    their way into our clean system. With this in mind we need to delete the
    old source directories and uncompress the packages again. As
    <strong>root</strong> run the following commands.

    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources
rm -rf */
for i in *.gz *.bz2 *.xz ; do echo "Unarchiving: $i"; tar xf $i ; done</pre>
    </section>

    <h2>General Build Advice</h2>
    <p>Below is general advice to help you build your VM successfully.</p>

    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>Chapter six is by far the longest chapter to get through in the book.
    This chapter not only has long build times but there are a lot of packages
    to install. The chapter is broken into 65 sections! The glibc, binutils,
    gcc, and coreutils will take you the longest to install. So plan your
    time accordingly.</p>

    <p>As with chapter five, this chapter keeps with the SBU system. Given
    an SBU  of two minutes, we can calculate how much time you will need to
    finish chapter six. I went through the chapter and totaled the listed SBU's
    and came up with 114.6 SBU's. So for my machine it would take
    <strong>3 hours</strong> and <strong>49 minutes</strong>, i.e. (2 * 114.6)
    / 60, to complete this chapter. </p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Testing can take a long, long time. So my advice is to only do the
    mandatory tests. The book is quite explicit on what tests
    <strong>cannot</strong> be skipped. Remember that some software, e.g.
    <code>gcc</code>, is so complex there are known and expected failures.
    Read the book carefully, and use your judgment, to decide whether an
    failure really matters or if you can go on.</p>

    <h3>What To Do When A Build Fails</h3>

    <p>You may enter a situation where a build fails for some reason.
    This usually occurs because of an unmet dependency. This means a
    previous program was not installed properly, although it may have
    reported that it was. There is no silver bullet solution to these
    problems. You need to try and figure out from what the make file
    was doing what caused the error. Some packages will give you
    good error messages, others will not.</p>

    <p>For example, I could not get the Kmod package to build. It could not
    find the <span class="file">lzma.h</span> file. To solve this problem
    I Googled <q>linux from scratch lzma.h</q> and discovered that
    the file was provided by the Xz package. So I rebuilt and reinstalled
    the Xz package. This solved the missing
    <span class="file">lzma.h</span> file problem. But the Kmod package
    still would not build. I hypothesized that the directory was now
    in a bad state. So I deleted the <span class="file">kmod-5</span>
    directory and then uncompressed the package's archive to give me a clean
    slate. The package now built easily. I went ahead and did the tests to
    double check that everything was now good.</p>

    <p>This is just an small example of all the possible things that could go
    wrong. If you get stuck with an error, you can as always
    come see me. But to use your time more efficiently you should try
    to solve the problem on your own.</p>

    <h2>Section by Section Advice</h2>
    <p>For most of this chapter you simply need to follow the book's
    directions. However there are a couple of sections that have special
    considerations.</p>

    <h3>6.3. Package Management</h3>
    <p>This section offers a broad overview of how package management works in
    the various Linux distributions. I highly recommend you read this section
    carefully. We are not using any form of package management, however, because
    using a package manager is antithetical to what LFS is trying to teach
    you. In other words, there is no directions to follow in this section.</p>

    <p>After reading this section, I highly recommend that you reboot your
    VM. You have at this point built a ton of packages. Your VM's RAM is
    probably pretty fragmented. Also, this will give you a clean slate
    to work off of.</p>

    <p>Once you have rebooted run the script below to return you to a good
    state. Afterwards, just continue onto section 6.4.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">export LFS=/mnt/lfs
mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda1 $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda2 $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 $LFS/sources
if ! grep -q sda3 /proc/swaps; then /sbin/swapon -v /dev/sda3; fi
mknod -m 600 $LFS/dev/console c 5 1
mknod -m 666 $LFS/dev/null c 1 3
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev
mount -vt devpts devpts $LFS/dev/pts -o gid=5,mode=620
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
mount -vt tmpfs shm $LFS/dev/shm
</pre>


    <h3>6.17 GCC</h3>
    <p>Before compiling GCC you are going to need to free up a lot of disk
    space. We are going to do this by deleting the build directories for
    binutils and glibc.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">rm -rf $LFS/sources/{bin,glibc}*/</pre>

    <p>After you build the GCC binary files, the chapter will ask you to
    test them. Do not skip this test! The estimated SBU's are,
    in my opinion, way off. The testing took me about two hours. I personally,
    start the tests leave your computer alone for several hours. Even though
    the process is quite lengthy, the test are very important. I have, in the
    past, had students who skipped this step, only to have it come back and
    bite them later on in the book.</p>

    <p>You also need to be aware that there are some expected
    failures. The script that generates the summaries scrolls by on the
    screen to fast for you to read, and there are no pagers installed
    in the chroot environment. To view the test results run the
    following commands.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">../gcc-[0-9]*/contrib/test_summary > /tmp/tests</pre>

    <p>In a new console that is outside of the chroot environment run
    this command:</p>

    <pre class="cmd">less /mnt/lfs/tmp/tests</pre>

    <p>This will let you view the test log file using <code>less</code>,
    which is the same pager man pages use.</p>

    <p>Compiling and testing GCC takes up a lot disk space, over 1GB.
    You will need to scavenge this space back to finish chapter
    six. Use the command below to free up this space (be sure to run
    this only after you have completely finished 6.17).</p>

    <pre class="cmd">cd $LFS/sources && rm -rf $LFS/sources/gcc*/</pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>After Rebooting Your VM</h2>
    <p>As you will quickly realize, we need slightly different directions to
    come back after rebooting our VM. The script below will get you up and
    running. You will need to <strong>complete sections 6.1&ndash;6.4</strong>
    before using it. If you are working on 6.1&ndash;6.4 then just use the
    previous reboot script.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">export LFS=/mnt/lfs
mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda1 $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda2 $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 $LFS/sources
if ! grep -q sda3 /proc/swaps; then /sbin/swapon -v /dev/sda3; fi
mknod -m 600 $LFS/dev/console c 5 1
mknod -m 666 $LFS/dev/null c 1 3
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev
mount -vt devpts devpts $LFS/dev/pts -o gid=5,mode=620
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
mount -vt tmpfs shm $LFS/dev/shm
chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root                  \
    TERM="$TERM"                \
    PS1='\u:\w\$ '              \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin \
    /tools/bin/bash --login +h</pre>
