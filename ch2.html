  <h1>Chapter 2 Creating the File System</h1>
</header>
<section class="intro">
  <p>As we have discussed creating a proper filesystem is
  essential to creating a Linux installation that works well. Do to the
  limitations of our disk, you need to follow the directions below instead of
  those found in chapter two of the book.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Partitioning The System</h2>
  <p>We need to come up with a good partitioning scheme first and foremost. You
  must use the scheme below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="file">/dev/sda</span>
    <ul>
      <li>3GB for /</li>
      <li>256MB for /home</li>
      <li>The rest is for swap. We are using a large swap space to make
      up for the low RAM situation.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><span class="file">/dev/sdb</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Everything goes to <span class="file">/mnt/lfs/source</span>.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol>

  <p>As your disk stands it is essentially empty. The fdisk program may give
  you a warning about this, just ignore it. The primary virtual hard drive
  should be the <span class="file">/dev/sda</span> device. Below is what
  your partition table should look like after using <code>fdisk</code> on
  <span class="file">/dev/sda</span>.</p>

  <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">fdisk -l /dev/sda</span>
Disk /dev/sda: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 522 cylinders, total 8388608 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0xe1cc3e22

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1            2048     6293503     3145728   83  Linux
/dev/sda2         6293504     6817791      262144   83  Linux
/dev/sda3         6817792     8388607      785408   83  Linux
</pre>

  <p>Building Linux takes a lot of room. As you may have noticed our virtual
  hard drive is very small. To make up for this deficit we are going to use
  a seperate hard drive to do the actual compiling and to store the sources
  code. This device should be <span class="file">/dev/sdb</span>. As mentioned
  in the chart above, you basically want just one big partition. Below is what
  your partition table should look like after using <code>fdisk</code> on
  <span class="file">/dev/sdb</span>.</p>

  <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">fdisk -l /dev/sdb</span>
Disk /dev/sdb: 4294 MB, 4294967296 bytes
43 heads, 32 sectors/track, 6096 cylinders, total 8388608 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0xf9034dc3

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1            2048     8388607     4193280   83  Linux
</pre>

  <h2>Formatting The Filesystem</h2>
  <p>You need to make <span class="file">/dev/sda1</span>,
  <span class="file">/dev/sda2</span>, and <span class="file">/dev/sdb1</span>
  use the ext4 filesystem. The <span class="file">/dev/sda3</span> partition
  should be made into a swap partition. If you are not sure what to do, look at
  the <a href="../lectures/12-Filesystems.html">lecture notes</a>.</p>

  <h2>Mounting the Filesystems</h2>
  <p>In order to use the partitions we must mount them. The book assumes that
  the installed system will be at <code>$LFS</code>. This makes it easy for
  the book to refer to the absolute path on our system. We also need to
  create the directories that we will use to mount the
  <span class="file">/home</span> and <span class="file">/sources</span> (build)
  directory. We then tell the OS to start using our new swap space.</p>

  <pre class="cmd">export LFS=/mnt/lfs
mkdir -v $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda1 $LFS
mkdir -pv $LFS/{home,sources}
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda2 $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 $LFS/sources
/sbin/swapon -v /dev/sda3</pre>

  <p>There is a handy program that tells you about the space on a mounted
  filesystem. Below is the command and the expected output. The highlighted
  lines are the filesystems you created.</p>
  <pre class="edit"><span class="cmd">df -h</span>
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
rootfs          1.5G   30M  1.5G   2% /
udev             10M     0   10M   0% /dev
tmpfs           305M  544K  304M   1% /run
/dev/sr0        433M  433M     0 100% /lib/live/mount/medium
/dev/loop0      413M  413M     0 100% /lib/live/mount/rootfs/filesystem.squashfs
tmpfs           1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /lib/live/mount/overlay
tmpfs           1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /lib/live/mount/overlay
aufs            1.5G   30M  1.5G   2% /
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           609M     0  609M   0% /run/shm
tmpfs           1.5G   20K  1.5G   1% /tmp
tmpfs           1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /var/tmp
<mark>/dev/sda1       2.9G  4.6M  2.8G   1% /mnt/lfs
/dev/sda2       240M  2.1M  222M   1% /mnt/lfs/home
/dev/sdb1       3.9G  8.0M  3.7G   1% /mnt/lfs/sources</mark>
</pre>

  <p>Why are the sizes different than expected? The reason is that fdisk rounds
  sizes down to the nearest cylinder. This means that sizes usually come up a
  little smaller than expected. Furthermore, the meta-data for the filesystem
  takes up space. This fine for our case.</p>

  <p>This would be a good time to take your first snapshot.</p>
