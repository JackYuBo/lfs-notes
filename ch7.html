    <h1>Chapter 7 Setting Up System Bootscripts</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
  <section class="intro">
    <p>Here we have to configure our boot system. Several
    sections in the book are not compatible with our system. Each
    section below is meant to be a replacement for the listed section in the
    book.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>After Reboot</h2>
    <p>We need to make some small alterations to our reboot script in order to
    utilize the programs we just created.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">export LFS=/mnt/lfs
mkdir -v $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda1 $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sda2 $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 $LFS/sources
mount -v --bind /dev $LFS/dev
mount -vt devpts devpts $LFS/dev/pts
mount -vt tmpfs shm $LFS/dev/shm
mount -vt proc proc $LFS/proc
mount -vt sysfs sysfs $LFS/sys
swapon /dev/sda3

chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1="\u:\w$ " \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin /bin/bash \
    --login +h</pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.2 General Network Configuration</h2>
    <p>The book would have
    have you set up a static IP address in this section. Instead, we are going
    to setup our VM to use a dynamic IP address using DHCP. This is done much
    later in the notes. Just skip this section entirely.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>7.3 Customizing the /etc/hosts File</h2>
    <p>The <span class="file">hosts</span> file sets up basic routing
    information. Generally this file only has one line. This line
    specifies that the DNS address <em>localhost</em> resolves to
    <em>127.0.0.1</em> which is the loopback device. Use this
    <span class="file">hosts</span> file instead of the one given in the
    book.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cat &gt; /etc/hosts &lt;&lt; "EOF"
# Begin /etc/hosts (network card version)

127.0.0.1 localhost lfs

# End /etc/hosts
EOF</pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.4 Device and Module Handling</h2>
    <p>This section is full of useful information on how Linux handles devices.
    You should read it. However, there are no actions that need to be taken
    in this section.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.5 Creating Custom Symlinks to Devices</h2>
    <p>There is nothing to be done in this section. The udev service should
    correctly guess where the CD-ROM is located.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.6 &amp; 7.7</h2>
    <p>Follow the directions in the book.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.8 Configuring The System Hostname</h2>
    <p>Use <em>lfs</em> as the hostname of your VM.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">echo 'HOSTNAME=lfs' > /etc/sysconfig/network</pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.9 Configuring the setclock Script</h2>
    <p>The clock on your VM is might be off by quite a bit. We are going to
    use local time on our VM as opposed to UTC. To set the time use the
    following line. You will need to fill in the correct time and date
    information.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">date --set="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00"</pre>

    <p>After setting the date, continue on through 7.9 in the book.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.10&ndash;7.12</h2>
    <p>These directions do not pertain to us. Read these sections because they
    contain useful information, but do not follow any of their directions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.13 The Bash Shell Startup Files</h2>
    <p>Use the following for the profile file.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cat &gt; /etc/profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"
# Begin /etc/profile

export LANG=en_US.iso88591

# End /etc/profile
EOF</pre>

    <p>Additionally, we need to make a more useful and friendly
    environment for when we log on after we have finished building
    the system.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">cat >/root/.bash_profile &lt;&lt;EOF
#!/bin/bash

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
[ -z "$PS1" ] && return

# set a fancy color prompts
if [ "$UID" == "0" ] ; then
  PS1='\[\033[01;31m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \[\033[01;31m\]\$ \[\033[00m\]'
  PS2='\[\033[01;31m\]> \[\033[00m\]'
else
  PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \[\033[01;32m\]\$ \[\033[00m\]'
  PS2='\[\033[01;32m\]> \[\033[00m\]'
fi

#Colorize ls output (directories will be blue now)
alias ls='ls --color=auto'

#Useful shortcuts for building packages
alias cmi='./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install'
alias mi='make && make install'

export MAKEFLAGS="-j $(grep 'processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)"
EOF</pre>

    <p>Make our new settings take effect.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">source /root/.bash_profile</pre>

    <p>Finally, we need a <span class="file">.bashrc</span> file for non-login terminals. In this
    case we want it to be identical to our login terminal.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cat >/root/.bashrc &lt;&lt;EOF
#!/bin/bash

source ~/.bash_profile
EOF</pre>

    <p>Make the bash startup files available to new users</p>
    <pre class="cmd">mkdir -v /etc/skel
cp -v /root/.bashrc /root/.bash_profile /etc/skel</pre>
    </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7.14 Creating The /etc/inputrc File</h2>
    <p>Follow the directions listed in the book.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Installing Additional Software</h2>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.1em;">After finishing chapter
    seven, you should then do this section.</p>

    <p>If we stopped at the software in chapter six we would not get very far.
    That chapter only installs enough software to create a "usable" system.
    The system that is made is not terribly useful, as it is missing some key
    pieces of software. This software is found in the sequel to the book
    called
    <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/index.html">
    Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS)</a>. The software we need to install
    is: a DHCP client, the mouse daemon, a web browser, and a
    file downloader.

    <p>Each section below will outline the installation procedure for each
    piece of software. As with the book you should then automatically
    uncompress the package and <code>cd</code> into that directory
    before continuing.</p>

    <p>You will need to download several files to build the packages. Using
    a new console (outside the chroot environment), download the following
    packages using this script.</p>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> BLFS is updated quite frequently. One or more
    of the URLs below may no longer work. This is usually because they updated
    to a slightly new version of the software. If you run into a failed
    download, please tell the instructor so he can update these notes.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">
cat > /tmp/package-list &lt;&lt;EOF

pushd /mnt/lfs/sources
wget -i /tmp/package-list && rm -vf /tmp/package-list
popd</pre>

    <p>After downloading the scripts, switch back to the chroot environment.
    We can then build these tools just like we did in chapter six.</p>

    <h3>Blfs-bootscripts</h3>
    <p>Both the DHCP client and the mouse daemon require boot scripts so that
    they start automatically. Lucky for us, the authors of BLFS wrote them.
    All we need to do is unarchive them, go ahead and do this now. We will
    install the necessary scripts with each package as we come to it.</p>

    <h3>dhcpcd &ndash; DHCP Client daemon</h3>
    <p>In order to get our network interface up and running we will need to
    use a DHCP client. A DHCP client allows us to dynamically discover routing
    information as well as get an assigned IP address. The build is pretty
    straight-forward.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">
./configure --libexecdir=/lib/dhcpcd --dbdir=/run --sysconfdir=/etc &&
make                                                                &&
make install                                                        &&
sed -i "s;/var/lib;/run;g" dhcpcd-hooks/50-dhcpcd-compat &&
install -v -m 644 dhcpcd-hooks/50-dhcpcd-compat /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/
</pre>

    <p>Now we need to install the boot script so the daemon starts
    automatically after a boot.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">
pushd ../blfs-bootscripts*/
make install-service-dhcpcd
popd
</pre>

    <p>In order for the networking services to configure our VM's Ethernet,
    we have to specify how to set it up in a configuration file.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">
cat &gt; /etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0 &lt;&lt;EOF
ONBOOT="yes"
IFACE="eth0"
SERVICE="dhcpcd"
DHCP_START="-b -q"
DHCP_STOP="-k"

# Set PRINTIP="yes" to have the script print
# the DHCP assigned IP address
PRINTIP="no"

# Set PRINTALL="yes" to print the DHCP assigned values for
# IP, SM, DG, and 1st NS. This requires PRINTIP="yes".
PRINTALL="no"
EOF
</pre>

    <h3>gpm &ndash; General Purpose Mouse daemon</h3>
    <p>This package contains a mouse server for the console. It provides copy
    and paste operations through the highlight-middle-click operation. We need
    this because it is faster and less error prone to copy and paste rather
    than typing each command by hand. Below are directions to install gpm.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">
./autogen.sh                                          &&
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc           &&
make                                                  &&
make install                                          &&
install-info --dir-file=/usr/share/info/dir           \
             /usr/share/info/gpm.info                 &&
ln -v -sfn libgpm.so.2.1.0 /usr/lib/libgpm.so         &&
install -v -m644 conf/gpm-root.conf /etc              &&
install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/gpm-1.20.7/support &&
install -v -m644    doc/support/*                     \
                    /usr/share/doc/gpm-1.20.7/support &&
install -v -m644    doc/{FAQ,HACK_GPM,README*}        \
                    /usr/share/doc/gpm-1.20.7</pre>

    <p>Now we need to set up the boot scripts so that the daemon starts
    automatically at boot.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">pushd ../blfs-bootscripts*/ && make install-gpm && popd</pre>

    <p>Finally, we need to setup the configuration file for the mouse daemon.
    The configuration file tells the daemon what device your mouse is and what
    protocol it uses. The settings below should be safe on most systems, and
    will definitely work with the VM.</p>
    <pre class="cmd">cat &gt; /etc/sysconfig/mouse &lt;&lt; "EOF"
# Begin /etc/sysconfig/mouse

MDEVICE="/dev/input/mice"
PROTOCOL="imps2"
GPMOPTS=""

# End /etc/sysconfig/mouse
EOF</pre>

    <h3>Wget &ndash; Our File Downloader</h3>
    <p>We will need <code>wget</code> so we can partially script the build
    for Xorg. Unfortunately, one of the items uses HTTPS. To enable
    <code>wget</code> to understand HTTPS downloads we have to install one
    optional component, namely OpenSSL.</p>

    <h4>OpenSSL (wget's dependency)</h4>
    <p>OpenSSL is a library used to interpret SSL connections. We need it
    so we can make HTTPS connections which are encrypted using SSL. To install
    OpenSSL simply do the following in its package directory:</p>

    <pre class="cmd">
patch -Np1 -i ../openssl-1.0.1*pod*.patch                           &&
patch -Np1 -i ../openssl-1.0.1*parallel*.patch                      &&
export openssl_pkg=$(basename $(pwd))                               &&
./config --prefix=/usr zlib-dynamic --openssldir=/etc/ssl shared    &&
make                                                                &&
make MANDIR=/usr/share/man install                                  &&
install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/doc/$openssl_pkg                     &&
cp -v -r doc/* /usr/share/doc/$openssl_pkg</pre>

    <h4>Install wget</h4>
    <p>We can now build and install <code>wget</code>. This is a really
    simple process. From its build directory do the following:</p>
    <pre class="cmd">
./configure --prefix=/usr      \
            --sysconfdir=/etc  \
            --with-ssl=openssl &&
make                           &&
make install</pre>

    <h3>w3m &ndash; A Text Mode WWW Browser</h3>
    <p>In order to make the system usable you will need to be able to browse
    the web. That is <code>w3m</code>'s job. The <code>w3m</code> browser is
    pretty much the most advanced browser for the console. Before can install
    <code>w3m</codE> we need install its one dependency the <em>GC</em>
    package.</p>

    <h4>Build GC (w3m's dependency)</h4>
    <p>GC is a garbage collector for C/C++. To build this package, start in
    the package's directory and do the following:</p>

    <pre class="cmd">
sed -i 's#AM_CONFIG_HEADER#AC_CONFIG_HEADERS#' configure.ac &&
sed -i 's#AM_CONFIG_HEADER#AC_CONFIG_HEADERS#' libatomic_ops/configure.ac &&
sed -i 's#pkgdata#doc#' doc/doc.am &&
autoreconf -fi  &&
./configure --prefix=/usr      \
            --enable-cplusplus \
            --disable-static   \
            --docdir=/usr/share/doc/gc-7.2d &&
make</pre>

    <p>This library has broken before. I highly recommend that you run the
    check, it is less than 0.1 SBUs.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">make check</pre>

    <p>Now we need to actually install this library.</p>

    <pre class="cmd">
make install &&
install -v -m644 doc/gc.man /usr/share/man/man3/gc_malloc.3 &&
ln -sfv gc_malloc.3 /usr/share/man/man3/gc.3</pre>

    <h4>Install w3m</h4>
    <p>Alright, now we are ready to install <code>w3m</code>. From its
    package directory do the following:</p>
    <pre class="cmd">
patch -p1 &lt; ../w3m-0.5.3-bdwgc72-1.patch &&
sed -i 's/file_handle/file_foo/' istream.{c,h} &&
sed -i 's#gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0#& x11#' configure &&
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --libexecdir=/usr/lib &&
make &&
make install &&
install -v -m644 -D doc/keymap.default /etc/w3m/keymap &&
install -v -m644    doc/menu.default /etc/w3m/menu &&
install -v -m755 -d /usr/share/doc/w3m-0.5.3 &&
install -v -m644    doc/{HISTORY,READ*,keymap.*,menu.*,*.html} \
                    /usr/share/doc/w3m-0.5.3</pre>

    <p><code>w3m</code> is very user friendly compared to other console based
    web browsers. It handles the mouse very well. It does have some
    counter-intuitive features though. Most things are done through a
    right-click based popup menu. The most imporant option is the <em>Save
    Link</em> option. You highlight text for copy paste operations by holding
    down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key as you drag the mouse. You can travel
    backwards using the <kbd>Shift-B</kbd> key. You can follow a hyperlink in
    two ways. First you can place your cursor under the link, and hit
    <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Second, you can double click on the link.</p>

    <p>For more information you can view the online manual page at
    <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/MANUAL">http://w3m.sourceforge.net/MANUAL</a>.
