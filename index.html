    <p>Remember that Linux is just the kernel. You, in fact,
    mostly interact with the user land of the system. How the kernel and
    user land are related is a complex issue, the two are so inseparable that
    the term Linux has come to mean Linux kernel + GNU user land. To get a
    deeper understanding of what exactly goes into a Linux distribution, we are
    going to build a <em>Linux from Scratch</em> (LFS) system.  As you build
    the system you will quickly come to appreciate how complex a system Linux
    really is.</p>

    <p>Ideally you would install LFS on an actual computer. This can be a
    problematic since you will have work to do in other classes
    and you don't want your computer to be down for several weeks. With this in
    mind, we are going to install our system on a <em>virtual machine</em>
    (VM).</p>

    <p>There are several advantages to using VMs for an LFS install. First, you
    can perform the installation without corrupting your current operating
    system. In other words, messing up will not trash your system. This
    allows us to experiment more freely with less penalty for failure. Another
    advantage of using a virtual machine system is that you can backup the
    machine using snapshots. That way if you badly corrupt your LFS
    installation, you can restore back to a functioning system. Finally, by
    using a VM I know exactly what hardware you are using. This makes it much
    easier to diagnose problems if you encounter them. Many of these notes are
    predicated on the idea you are using the VM's virtual hardware.</p>

    <p>There is a major drawback to using a VM, the installation can be much
    slower compared to installing LFS on an actual machine. Running even a
    cut-down Linux distribution smoothly in a VM can take a fairly hefty
    machine. In other words, what would normally be a <strong>very</strong>
    responsive install on an actual machine may crawl on a VM. Worse, because
    you may be communicating with the virtual hard-drive through USB things will
    slow down quite a lot. We will discuss these issues in quite a
    bit of depth as we go along.</p>

    <p>Please note that these notes are updated frequently. As people run into
    problems, I update the notes to help others avoid those problems. That
    means you should always view the "live" notes from the class's website.</p>
