  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
</header>
<article>
  <section class="intro">
    <p>In this section we will create the virtual machine files. We will
    also boot the virtual machine into our build environment.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
    <p>Before we can actually create the VM, some things you need
    to take care of. First, we need to have a system where we can actually
    build the software. Next, we need to analyze the host system so we can
    optimize our VM. Choosing the optimal values for RAM and CPU cores can
    significantly decrease the build time.</p>

    <h3>Build Environment</h3>
    <p>I have created a fairly nice environment for us to use while building
    LFS. It is a custom LiveCD I created using much of the knowledge I gained
    form the first time I created LFS. The CD has all of the prerequisite
    software installed. So you will able to start right away.</p>

    <p>You can download the file below. Remember, put it on the machine's hard
    drive!</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">
      Download: <a href="./lfs-cd.iso" class="file">lfs-cd.iso</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Calculate the amount of RAM</h3>

    <p>Building software is a RAM intensive process. This is one area where
    throwing RAM at the problem will make a huge difference. This is an
    important and complex issue, so read the following carefully and make
    sure  that you understand the issues completely.</p>

    <p>When using <em>Windows</em>, this value <strong>must</strong> be
    set to <em>25%</em> of the total available RAM.  This is why you need at
    least 2GB of main memory on your physical machine.</p>

    <p>Linux and Macs, on the other hand, are not as resource intensive, so you
    can raise this up to 50% of your total main memory. This assumes you are
    not going to be using the physical machine for anything else while you
    are running the LFS virtual machine.</p>

    <p>The problem is that this value should not change between the
    different physical machines you are going to use this VM on. So if you
    plan on doing <strong>any work</strong> on a different machine you
    <strong>must</strong> set this value to the appropriate
    <strong>minimum</strong> value. For example, if you are going to build
    LFS on an Ubuntu Linux machine with 4GB of RAM, and work on it at
    school on a Windows machine 3GB of RAM, set the virtual machine's RAM to
    <em>768MB</em>.</p>

    <p>For simplicities sake, we are going to build a 32-bit operating system.
    The main effect of this decision is that the OS cannot access any RAM
    greater than 3GB. In other words, <strong>3GB is the maximum</strong> amount
    of RAM you can use.</p>

    <p>After you have decided on how much RAM to use, write it down.</p>

    <h3>Determining The Number of Cores</h3>
    <p>You can compile much of LFS in parallel. This means you can take
    advantage of the multi-core nature of modern computers. Virtualbox only
    allows you to use multiple cores if your host computer has Vt-x or AMD-V
    enabled.</p>

    <p>On most AMD multi-core machines, AMD-V is available. Unfortunately,
    Intel segments its processor pricing partially based on have Vt-x or not.
    This means it is difficult to predict if a particular processor has Vt-x
    or not. To further complicate the issue, many commodity motherboards disable
    these visualization extensions in the BIOS.</p>

    <p>You best bet is to try turning on the extensions in the VM's settings.
    VirtualBox should complain if it cannot access the extensions.</p>

    <p>The easiest way to find out if the extensions are available is to
    google for your processor's model and Vt-x or AMD-V. You should be able to
    determine if they are available on the processor. If it is available,
    but VirtualBox cannot access the extension, then it is probably disabled
    in your motherboard's BIOS. Try finding a setting that will enable it.</p>

    <h2>Creating the VM</h2>
    <p>LFS is going to need to be installed into a new virtual machine. Start
    by clicking the <button>New</button> button in VirtualBox.
    <ol>
      <li>Set the VM's name to "<em>lfs</em>" and set the OS type to "<em>Linux
      2.6/3.x</em>"</li>
      <li>Set the amount of RAM to the value you wrote down a minute ago. Be
      sure to use proper 2<sup>n</sup> number, i.e. 1GB = 1024.</li>
      <li>We now need to create our virtual machine's hard drive.
      <ol>
        <li>Make the image a VDI file (default).
        <li>Make the image a dynamically expanding (default), this option works
        best on USB.</li>
        <li>The image name should be "<em>lfs</em>" (the default). The disk
        should be 4GB in size.</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Our VM is created, but we are not done yet. We are going to need a
    special "build" hard drive and we need it to boot off of a ISO
    image.
    <ol>
      <li>Select <span class="file">lfs</span> from the VM list and click the
      <button>Settings</button>.</li>

      <li>Click <em>System</em> to bring up the system management page.</li>

      <li>Click the <em>Processor</em> tab to and make sure <strong>Enable
      PAE/NX</strong> is checked.</li>

      <li>If you have the Vt-x or AMD-V extension enabled, you need to do the
      following. Set the number of processors, on the <em>Processor</em> tab,
      to 50% of your system's physical cores. On the <em>Motherboard</em> tab,
      check the <strong>Enable I/O ACPI</strong> box. Finally, on the
      <em>Acceleration</em> tab, make sure both boxes are checked.</li>

      <li>Click <em>Storage</em> in the left panel to bring up the
      storage page.</li>

      <li>Under <q>Controller: IDE</q> click on the empty CDROM entry.</li>

      <li>On the right hand side, click on CD icon to bring up a list of known
      ISO files. Your list is probably empty. Click the
      <strong>Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file.</strong>

      <li>You will need to select the <span class="file">
      <a href="./lfs-cd.iso">lfs-cd.iso</a></span>
      file you downloaded. Note, <strong>do not put this file on your USB
      drive</strong> as this will cause a  huge loss in performance.</li>

      <li>Click the <em>Controller: SATA</em> entry. Click the <strong>Add
      Hard Disk</strong> button (second button in the highlighted entry).</li>
      <li>In the resulting dialog box, click the <button>Create new
      disk</button> button.
      <ol>
        <li>Make the image a VDI file (default).</li>
        <li>Make the image a dynamically expanding (default), this option works
        best on USB.</li>
        <li>The image name should be "<em>LFS Build</em>". The disk
        should be 4GB in size.</li>
        <li>Click the <button>Create</button> button.</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Booting From The CD</h2>
    <p>We are finally ready to get started! Because your VM's hard drive is
    blank, your machine will boot from the CDROM, a.k.a the LFS ISO image file.
    You will see a bunch of messages scroll by as the OS boots. These messages
    are for debugging purposes in case you have trouble booting the
    ISO file.</p>

    <p>Eventually you will reach the desktop. This is an LXDE desktop. The
    desktop has a <q>Start Menu</q> in the lower left corner of the screen.
    I have already installed the VirtualBox Guest Additions. Hence, the screen
    resolution should match the VM's window size.</p>

    <h2>Advice &mdash; Read This!!!!</h2>
    <p>Below is some advice that I had to learn the hard way. I really
    recommend that you read it carefully. It will save you time and quite a
    bit of effort.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
    <h3>Tips On Using VirtualBox</h3>
    <table class="borderless"><tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Host+f</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>This puts the VM in full screen mode. I highly recommend
        that you use the VM in this mode.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Host+t</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>This will take a snapshot of the machine's state.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>One of the best features of a virtual machine is its ability to take
    <em>snapshots</em>. A <em>snapshot</em> is a record of written to disk of
    the virtual machine's state at the time the snapshot was taken. This
    means basically that a image is taken of the VM's RAM and hard drive.
    The benefit is that at any time you can revert back to a previous snap
    shot.</p>

    <p>You will mess up somewhere while creating your LFS system. Taking
    frequent snapshots will allow you to revert back to a "good" state. You
    can think of snapshots as "game saves." They allow you to jump backwards
    in time to whenever you took the snapshot.</p>

    <h3>Maximizing Virtual Machine Performance</h3>
    <p>VM's by their nature run slower than an installed OS. But there are ways
    to squeeze pretty good performance out of them. The first is to cut-down on
    running applications in the host system. The host system's multitasking may
    treat the VM as just any other application. When you are doing a sixty
    minute compile, you do not want the host to give the VM the same priority
    as Firefox. So, do not run any applications in the host while the VM is
    running. This is not an absolute rule though. If you have a fast machine,
    a lot of time, or copious amounts of RAM you can multi-task in the host
    OS. I would still recommend that you do not do it on the longer and more
    intensive compiles. The easiest way to avoid multitasking in the host OS is
    to run VirtualBox in full-screen mode, this way you avoid the
    temptation.</p>

    <h3>The Book</h3>
    <p>Linux from Scratch (LFS) is installed by following all the steps in a
    book. For your convenience I have placed the book onto the desktop of the
    LiveCD. Use that book, not the one listed on their website. The one on
    their website gets updated frequently. The off-line copy is a stable
    version, you are less likely to run into new bugs.</p>

    <p>It is <strong>very</strong> important that you read and understand the
    white part of the book. This is what will make up the majority of your next
    test, so pay attention. The book is not overly long, you could read it
    cover to cover in about five hours. Don't just blindly copy/paste the
    steps this will cause you to fail certain steps. Realize that creating
    a LFS system is difficult, time consuming, and error prone. You may need
    to make multiple tries at each part before you get a working system.</p>

    <p>Do to how the book has you do the steps, you need to be able to get
    better performance out of your terminal window. Use the LXterminal (it is
    in the shortcut bar) rather than xterm, it has more features (like a
    working copy-paste system). LXterminal works essentially just like
    the terminal emulator we have used in class. Here is a list of short-cuts
    that will be of great benefit.</p>

    <table class="borderless"><tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl+Shift+T</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>Open a new terminal in a new tab.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl+PgUp</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>Cycle to the previous tab.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl+PgDn</kbd><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>Cycle to the next tab.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>Copy selected text to the clipboard.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>Past text from the clipboard into the current terminal at the
        insertion point.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>Middle&#8209;Click</kbd></td><td>&mdash;</td>
        <td>This will paste any highlighted text into the current terminal at
        the insertion point. You can simulate the middle-mouse button by
        pressing both the left and right buttons simultaneously. This is
        usually the fastest way to copy and paste.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
